This project features a contact form for Virtual Tech Services, created using HTML, CSS, and PHP, designed to run on WAMPServer 2.0. The form allows users to submit their first name, last name, email, college/institute name, and message. Upon submission, a PHP script processes the data and stores it in a MySQL database. The frontend consists of an HTML form styled with CSS, providing an intuitive interface. The backend PHP script (`2.php`) connects to a MySQL database and inserts the submitted data into a table named `raat`. Developed and tested using WAMPServer 2.0, the project utilizes Apache, MySQL, and PHP to create a local server environment for seamless integration and testing. To set up and run this project, install WAMPServer 2.0, start the Apache and MySQL services, create the necessary database and table, update the PHP script with your database credentials, place the project files in the `www` directory.
